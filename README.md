### 😀 &nbsp;About Me
I'm **[Dev Patel](https://github.com/dev-08)**, I’m Dev Patel — a Software Engineer and CS grad who enjoys building smart systems that scale and teaching software (and sometimes AI) to behave under real-world conditions. My sweet spot sits at the intersection of distributed systems, microservices architecture, and applied AI. By day, I design service-oriented platforms, define clean API contracts, and build reliable, high-performance backend systems using patterns like asynchronous processing, caching, and event-driven workflows. By curiosity, I explore how LLMs, NLP, and intelligent automation can plug into distributed systems to make them more adaptive, personalized, and efficient.
I’m especially interested in AI-augmented backend systems—where LLMs support decision-making, data pipelines scale gracefully, and microservices remain fault-tolerant and observable. Because great software shouldn’t just be intelligent — it should be reliable, scalable, and fun to build.If it involves distributed coordination, system design, or blending AI into production systems, chances are I’m excited about it.
